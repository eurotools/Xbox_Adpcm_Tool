### Features
This tool can be used to encode 16-bits PCM Wav files to the Xbox ADPCM Format, and vice-versa. 

It is only compatible with headerless Xbox ADPCM files, so, to decode a Xbox ADPCM file is required to know previously the frequency and the number of channels to avoid undesired results when decoding.
